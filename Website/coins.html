            <h1>BITCOIN</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>•Bitcoin (₿) is a decentralized digital currency, without a central bank or single administrator, that can be sent from user to user on the peer-to-peer bitcoin network without the need for intermediaries.</p>
                <p>•Transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. The cryptocurrency was invented in 2008 by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto</p>
                <p>•Bitcoins are created as a reward for a process known as mining. They can be exchanged for other currencies, products, and services. Bitcoin has been criticized for its use in illegal transactions, the large amount of electricity (and thus carbon footprint) used by mining, price volatility, and thefts from exchanges.</p>

            <h1>ETHEREUM</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>•Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain with smart contract functionality. Ether (ETH or Ξ) is the native cryptocurrency of the platform. Amongst cryptocurrencies, Ether is second only to Bitcoin in market capitalization.</p>
                <p>•Ethereum was conceived in 2013 by programmer Vitalik Buterin. In 2014, development work commenced and was crowdfunded, and the network went live on 30 July 2015.</p>
                <p>• Decentralized finance (DeFi) applications provide a broad array of financial services without the need for typical financial intermediaries like brokerages, exchanges, or banks, such as allowing cryptocurrency users to borrow against their holdings or lend them out for interest.</p>

            <h1>SOLANA</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>•Solana is a public blockchain platform. It achieves consensus using the proof of stake mechanism. Its internal cryptocurrency is SOL.</p>
                <p>•In 2021, Bloomberg journalist Joanna Ossinger described Solana as "a potential long-term rival for Ethereum", citing superior transaction speeds and lower associated costs.</p>
                <p>• On 14 September 2021, the Solana blockchain went offline after a surge of transactions caused the network to fork, and different validators had different views on the state of the network. The network was shortly brought back online on 15 September 2021. Solana can purportedly handle 50,000 transactions per second, which is faster than the Ethereum blockchain, but still less than the 400,000 transactions seen during the spike.</p>

            <h1>LITECOIN</h1>
            <ul>
                <p>•Litecoin (LTC or Ł) is a peer-to-peer cryptocurrency and open-source software project released under the MIT/X11 license. Litecoin was an early bitcoin spinoff or altcoin, starting in October 2011. In technical details, Litecoin is nearly identical to Bitcoin.</p>
                <p>•Litecoin was a source code fork of the Bitcoin Core client, differing primarily by having a decreased block generation time (2.5 minutes), increased maximum number of coins, different hashing algorithm (scrypt, instead of SHA-256), and a slightly modified GUI.</p>
